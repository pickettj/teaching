    "### Data Format\n",
    "\n",
    "As always when thinking about digital methods, start from the *method*, not the software. Software comes and goes, the core logic stays the same. So: what do we need in order to model data in geographic space? To put a point on a map, all we need is the lattitude and longitude. For most geospatial software, you can add this information \"by hand,\" but in practice you will generally be *importing* a dataset. Two common formats for importing geospatial data are: GeoJSON and CSV (comma separated values).\n",

If you take a picture with your phone, you are producing a *raster* image, which is made up of a grid of pixels (or cells). If you zoom in, the picture will become grainy as you get closer to the pixels.\n",
