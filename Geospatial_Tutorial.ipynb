    "### Data Format\n",
    "\n",
    "As always when thinking about digital methods, start from the *method*, not the software. Software comes and goes, the core logic stays the same. So: what do we need in order to model data in geographic space? To put a point on a map, all we need is the lattitude and longitude. For most geospatial software, you can add this information \"by hand,\" but in practice you will generally be *importing* a dataset. Two common formats for importing geospatial data are: GeoJSON and CSV (comma separated values).\n",

If you take a picture with your phone, you are producing a *raster* image, which is made up of a grid of pixels (or cells). If you zoom in, the picture will become grainy as you get closer to the pixels.\n",

    "Our join table, `df_journeys`, had two columns representing *foreign keys*: `Location_ID` and `Person_ID`. Those columns each had a one-to-many relationship to the `UID` columns in their respecting corresponding tables. We joined them into one single table with all the information in a single place so we can use it for our geospatial visualizations.\n",

However, that would also have meant maintaining redundant information: Marco Polo is always born in 1254, and if you reproduce that data manually every single time in the join table, you open yourself up to user-error. With the workflow above, you can worry about tracking information about people / places separately, and simply re-run the merge to update your map.\n",

    "The above methods will get you to a set of points on a map with some assocaited attributes you can style... which is pretty good! Programs like QGIS allow you to use something like Google Maps as a backdrop layer so that you can see where they fall on a modern global map.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you want full control over the geographical features that your map displays? For that, you might start by downloading some *shape files*. Shape files come in various formats, and are vectors / polygons, which means they are essentially a series of connected points in space. You only need three points to make a polygon, but in practice the level of detail necessary to define a shoreline, for instance, would entail hundreds of thousands of points. Fortunately, you can download most [natural features](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/), and [modern political boundaries](https://www.geoboundaries.org/index.html#getdata), online and then simply import them into your map as a layer. (In QGIS, for instance, all you need to do is drag the file onto your map.)\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you want to create your own shape files? For instance, the Aral Sea looked a lot different a hundred years ago now, and the modern boundaries of Saudi Arabia are not terribly relevant if you are studying the Ottoman Empire. For well-studied topics, you may also be able to download historical shapefiles from existing digital mapping projects (for instance, through something like the [World Historical Gazetteer](https://whgazetteer.org/). But in practice, you may need to make your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite often this involves georeferencing: essentially, you take a raster image (e.g., of a historical map), \"stretch\" it over actual coordinates, and then tracing a polygon. Essentially, you are converting pixels into coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of different tools for doing this. In practice, the process is both fun (because it's kind of like drawing!), but also frustrating (because a lot of the software is rather buggy). Youc can read about the tool [QGIS offers for this here](https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_raster/georeferencer.html), but you can also georeference a raster image in another program ([for instance](https://lincolnmullen.com/projects/spatial-workshop/georectification.html)) and import it as a layer in QGIS. (A georeferenced raster image encodes geospatial coordinates onto the image itself, such that when you import it, the image is already in the right place on your map.)\n",
