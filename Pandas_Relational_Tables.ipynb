    "Welcome to **Jupyter Notebooks**! You probably installed Juypter via **Anaconda**. Anaconda is a suite of data science resources: one of the apps it installs is Jupyter (another especially useful one is VS Code). Jupyter is a workbook-style approach to implementing **Python** code. Python relies upon **libraries**, which are collections of functions relating to a particular task. **Pandas** is the most popular library aimed at working with tabular data, which can also approximate the functionality of a **relational database**.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is a mouthful, but the point is that we are going to use Pandas (a Python library) to manipulate and visualize tabular data, usually through the Jupyter interface. Pandas is hardly the only tool we could use to implement a relational database. Microsoft Access, Filemaker, and SQL (the latter of which refers to a language, not a particular app) are all also relational database. Pandas is free, open source, and (in my subjective opinion) easier to learn than the others."
